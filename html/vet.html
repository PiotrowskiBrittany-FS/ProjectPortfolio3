                    <h4>Foods That are Good for Dogs</h4>

                    <p>There are many foods that your dog can have, but also there are many foods that you need to avoid. We've created a list of the best foods that are actually good for dogs to eat. Here's the list:

                    <h4>How to Care for Your Dog in Their Sick Times</h4>
                    <h5>By Brittany Piotrowski</h5>
                    <p>Dogs get sick just like us. So how do we take care of them in their sick times? <br /><br />

                        The answer is that we ensure that we follow the vets requests to the best of our ability and ensure that they don't jump when they can't or do something they aren't supposed to while recovering. Dogs can't tell what they can and can't do, so they will try to live their life as they have been. <br /><br />
                        
                        Dogs are more typically more active than humans and enjoy jumping up on beds and couches to be closer to their owner, but we can always assist them and teach them to wait for commands so that when the time comes of injury or sickness, they will allow us to care for them and wait to hear the command before doing something they shouldn't. Ensuring our dog is eating well and drinking plenty of water is a great thing to do when caring for them in their sick time. Chicken broth is a good substitute for sick dogs so they can hydrate themselves and have that amazing taste as well.</p>
