                    <h4>Why Shave Your Dog?</h4>
                    <h5>By Brittany Piotrowski</h5>
                    <p>
                        Shaving a short-haired dog is something that dog owners don't typically think about. In the summer dogs need to shed their coat so they don't get too hot and they can sweat just as easily as we do. Shaving a dog, no matter if they have short or long hair is a good idea in the summer time. This ensures that they don't get too hot, but it is vet recommended to leave at least one-inch of hair so their skin can stay protected from sunburns, skin cancer from the sun and bug bites. Dogs have a natural coat that can protect their skin, so their coat should never get shaved too short. 

                        Some dogs get bacterial infections that can actually be caused by their own hair and outdoor irritants getting stuck and causing rashes. Shaving your dog to ensure that there isn't any chance of irritants getting stuck can ensure that bacterial infections are avoided. Active dogs will benefit the most from the shave by allowing owners to easily see fleas, ticks and other parasites within their coat. Dogs that enjoy swimming can avoid having maggots make a home in their wet coat by having shorter hair. Overall, shaving a short-haired dog can be a good thing, but remember to ensure that their hair is no less than one inch in length from their skin to ensure they can stay protected.
