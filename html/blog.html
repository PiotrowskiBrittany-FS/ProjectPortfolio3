                    <h4>Adventurous Things to do with Your Dog</h4>
                    <h5>By Brittany Piotrowski</h5>
                    <p>It's no question that dog is man's best friend, but what can we do to make sure that we take our best friend on adventures we would enjoy? 

                        Easy answer! Make a bucket list! It may sound silly, but dogs like to be us and experience new things just as much as humans. Finding new parks, new places and new things to do with your dog can ensure that they can spend more time with you and you get the benefit of a new adventure. 
                        
                        <br /><br /> Many places, including wineries are also becoming dog friendly so you can bring your pup with you when you go. In today's society, going to events with a dog is easier than ever before and many of these events advertise that they can bring a dog with them. Vacationing, camping, and boating are some great ideas for both you and your dog to enjoy, just remember to bring a life jacket! Not all dogs can swim. You will also want to ensure that your dog has all the vaccines that they need. If you aren't sure what vaccines they need, just ask one of our trusted vets!</p>
